StarGazer is a Discord Bot used to get images on Space with relevant news and information regarding the images taken. The Bot functions by pulling images and text using various NASA APIs, which return data in JSON format. 
The Bot allows you to choose photos from the current date, or from a perviously specified date.
The application was made in Coop with Misbah Imtiaz, for which we have also merged the NASA Mars API. The APIs used can also be used to provide the weather patterns on Mars (Currently in Dev).

Future implementation will allow you to read up on the latest news about mars with the provided relevent news by making use of Web Scraping.

Here are the current list commands below:
~MarsPOTD
~MarsDate
~MarsWeather (In Dev)
~SpacePOTD
~SpaceDate
